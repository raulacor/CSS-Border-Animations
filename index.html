        <p>You sit before your screen,
            the faint blue glow spilling like moonlight across your face,
            lines of code or words or thoughts
            flowing through your fingertips —
            and you realize:
            creation isn’t only for gods or poets,
            it’s for anyone who dares
            to make something from nothing.</p>
