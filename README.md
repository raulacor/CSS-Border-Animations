# ✨ CSS Border Annimation

A minimal and visually striking CSS experiment that creates a glowing animated gradient border effect using **conic gradients** and the **@property** rule. The design uses pure CSS — no JavaScript — to achieve a smooth, rotating border animation with a soft glow effect.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The `.card` element acts as a centered container on the page.  
2. Two pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`) are used to create the animated border effect.  
3. A **CSS custom property** `--angle` is defined using the `@property` rule to enable smooth transitions during animation.  
4. A **conic-gradient** is applied to these pseudo-elements, rotating endlessly using a keyframes animation (`@keyframes spin`).  
5. The `::before` pseudo-element adds a **blurred glow** for extra visual depth.
